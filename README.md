# Introduction

This repository contains sample AWS Lambda code that implements Product Catalog Management API exposed using API
Gateway.

# High Level Design Diagram

# Supported Use Cases

All CRUD operations regarding Products Catalog Management are supported:

* Product Creation
* Product Update
* Products Listing
* Product Retrieval based on ID
* Product Deletion

# Supported Product Attributes

* ID
* Name
* Description
* Category
* SKU

# API

TBD

# Deployment

Code is deployed using AWS SAM.

First, build the project:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

Then use AWS SAM to deploy it:

```shell
sam deploy
```

Once deployment is done, last line will show API URL:

```text
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CloudFormation outputs from deployed stack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outputs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key                 ApiEndpoint

Value               https://v7swljnkwc.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/

```

API will be available under API URL with StageName, in the above example it will, using get all products example:
